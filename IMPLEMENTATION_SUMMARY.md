## Technical Implementation

### Building Class
Uses `Building_Storage` - the same class as shelves, ensuring:

- Storage group linking
- Blueprint support

### Storage Settings
- **Fixed Settings**: Only allows Foods category
- **Default Settings**: Important priority, excludes human meat
- **Linkable**: Can be grouped with other food bowls

### Performance
- **Ticker**: Set to "Never" for optimal performance
- **No Custom Code**: Uses vanilla systems only

## Compatibility
- **RimWorld 1.6**: Fully compatible

- **Multiplayer**: Compatible

## Future Enhancements
- Custom graphics (currently uses placeholder bowl emojis)

## Notes
- Uses vanilla Building_Storage class for maximum compatibility
- Follows RimWorld XML patterns for proper integration
