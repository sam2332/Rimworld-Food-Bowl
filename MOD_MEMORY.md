# Food Bowl Mod - Development Memory

## Recent Fixes and Changes

### XML Cross-Reference Error Resolution (Current Session)
**Issue**: Multiple "Could not resolve cross-reference" errors for invalid ThingDef names
**ThingDefs with Errors**:
- `SimpleMeal` → Fixed to `MealSimple`
- `FineMeal` → Fixed to `MealFine` (plus variants `MealFine_Veg`, `MealFine_Meat`)
- `LavishMeal` → Fixed to `MealLavish` (plus variants `MealLavish_Veg`, `MealLavish_Meat`)
- `SurvivalMeal` → Fixed to `MealSurvivalPack`
- `PlantMatter` → Removed (this is a ThingCategory, not a ThingDef)
- `Meat_Insect` → Previously removed (invalid ThingDef)

**Resolution**: Updated `disallowedThingDefs` in Buildings_FoodBowl.xml with correct ThingDef names from RimWorld 1.6 game files.

**Verified Valid ThingDefs in Configuration**:
- Allowed: Hay, Kibble, Milk, InsectJelly, Pemmican, RawBerries, RawFungus, RawAgave
- Disallowed: Meat_Human, MealSimple, MealFine (all variants), MealLavish (all variants), MealSurvivalPack, MealNutrientPaste, Meat_Twisted

## Key Game Source References
- Meal ThingDefs: `Game XML DEFS/Data/Core/Defs/ThingDefs_Items/Items_Food.xml`
- Plant Resources: `Game XML DEFS/Data/Core/Defs/ThingDefs_Items/Items_Resource_RawPlant.xml`
- Animal Products: `Game XML DEFS/Data/Core/Defs/ThingDefs_Items/Items_Resource_AnimalProduct.xml`
